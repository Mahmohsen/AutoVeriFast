# Running VeriFast 14.5 32-bit on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit

# Before you do the following, trying to run a 32-bit executable
# yields a "No such file or directory" error (because the loader cannot be found)
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 # Installs the 32-bit shared library loader

After this, mysh works. However, verifast yields the following error message:
/home/bartj/verifast-14.5/bin/verifast-core: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
(This is probably a dependency of Z3.)

Now, do
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386

Now, the test suite runs fine.

sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386
sudo apt-get install libxml2:i386

Now, vfide works, but there are error messages in the console, and the menus are not in the right theme (they are shown in the window instead of at the top of the screen), leading to poor readability of the menus and toolbar:
(vfide-core:11728): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load type module: /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/menuproxies/libappmenu.so

sudo apt-get install appmenu-gtk:i386

Now the menu is shown at the top of the screen and is properly readable; however the GUI still looks poor and the following error message appears in the console:

(vfide-core:11899): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "murrine",
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"

sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine:i386

After installing murrine, the GUI displays properly.

(We still get the message
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
but this relates to sound and is not relevant to vfide since vfide does not use sound.)
